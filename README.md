# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project is used to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can also predict digits from real handwritten images.

## Tools Used
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Google Colab

## Dataset
MNIST handwritten digit dataset (28×28 grayscale images)

## Approach
- Load and preprocess the dataset  
- Build and train a CNN model  
- Test the model using MNIST test data  
- Predict digits from uploaded handwritten images  

## Result
The model achieves around **98% accuracy** and correctly predicts handwritten digits.

## Future Scope
Can be extended to recognize alphabets and multi-digit numbers.
